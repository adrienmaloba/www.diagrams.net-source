With most teachers and students now working virtually, as schools have been required to close due to the pandemic, the tools that support online teaching have been drastically improved. Many schools are now using Google Classroom to communicate with students, organise curriculum, and assign and submit assessment digitally.

Completing visual learning tasks is an important part of most subjects. Students will both have fun and extend their digital toolbox when creating visualisations in a rich diagramming app like draw.io.

With the draw.io add-on for Google Workplace (Google Drive), teachers and students can easily attach diagram files to announcements, assessment descriptions, and assignment submissions in Google Classroom. From there, it's only a click or two to see a diagram preview, and open it in the free draw.io editor.

**Install the draw.io add-on for Google Drive** 

1. Install the [draw.io add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/diagramsnet/671128082532).
2. You will need to [grant permission for draw.io to access the files in your Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-diagrams.html) before you first create or edit a diagram stored on Google Drive.

## Attach diagram files in Google Classroom

Google Classroom makes it easy to attach files, from Google Drive, on the web with a URL, or upload them from your computer. 

For example, when you are writing an announcement on your subject's _Stream_, click on _Add_, then select from the following locations.
* **Google Drive** - Attach a file that is stored in your Google Drive. 
* **Link** - Attach a [diagram that was published or exported as a URL](/doc/faq/export-to-url.html).
* **File** - Attach a diagram that is stored on your local device.

**Tip:** When the diagram file is stored in Google Drive, you will also see a diagram thumbnail wherever it is attached.

### Attach a diagram to an assignment

Adding a diagram to classwork - assignments, quiz assignments, questions, and course material can include file attachments. For assignments, you can select what should be done with the attached diagrams.

**View diagram:** To limit the diagram to view-only, leave the diagram file's attachment behaviour as _Students can view the file_ (it is the default behaviour).

**Edit original diagram file:** To allow all students to edit the file stored in your Google Drive account, select _Students can edit the file_ from the attachment behaviour list on the right. This is a useful choice for group work, especially as you can see who has made which change in the [diagram file's revision history on Google Drive](/doc/faq/google-drive-revision-history.html).

**Give each student a copy of the diagram:** To give each student their own copy of the file, select _Make a copy for each student_. When you _Assign_ and distribute the assessment to the students, Google Classroom will automatically save a copy of the diagram into the subject's folder on each student's Google Drive.

As the teacher, you will be able to open all of the diagram files assigned to students from the _Student work_ tab of the assignment detail page. 

## Open a diagram from Google Classroom

1. Click on the attached file to open a preview. If the diagram file is stored in Google Drive, you'll see the diagram in the new tab. 
2. If it was a file that was uploaded, and not stored in Google Drive, click on _Open with draw.io_ at the top of the browser tab to open it in the draw.io editor.

**Tip:** Add comments to diagrams stored in Google Drive simply by dragging a selection pane around an element of the diagram, and add your comment. This is useful for group work or when providing feedback to students on their assignment submissions (see below).

## Submit a diagram with an assignment

1. As a student, click on the assignment to see its details. 
2. In the _Your work_ section on the right, click _Add or create_.
3. Select Google Drive to attach a diagram file you have saved in your Google Drive. Alternatively, click _File_ to attach a diagram file you have saved on your computer.

4. Finally click _Hand in_ or _Mark as done_ to submit your diagram with your assignment. 

## Troubleshooting

Things can go wrong, and diagram files may be accidentally deleted. 

**Restore a deleted copy of the diagram file**

Even if the file is deleted from the student's Google Drive, teachers will be able to see the last saved version of the student's diagram file for some time. If the student has deleted their file by mistake, they can restore it from their Google Drive.

1. If you are a student, go to the _Bin_ folder in your Google Drive account.
2. Fight-click on the deleted diagram file, and select _Restore_.

**Restore a copy of the original assigned diagram**

2. Click on _Make a copy_ to restore the diagram to its original form.

**Fix a connection issue with Google Drive** 

It happens rarely, but you may see an error along the lines of ``Log in attempts failed.`` You may be able to [fix such a Google Drive connection issue in your browser](/doc/faq/google-drive-connection-problems.html). 
1. Unblock third-party cookies in your browser, remove browser extensions, and delete all Google cookies stored in your browser. 
2. Log back into Google Classroom or Google Drive to continue working with your diagrams in draw.io.

## Embed diagrams in Docs, Slides and Sheets

1. Export the diagram from with our free online draw.io editor at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) to a PNG image.
2. Then import that image file into your Google Doc, Slide or Sheet to embed their diagram.

**Note:** Google has applied new security limitations that limit how apps access files from Google Drive. If you have old, installed versions of these apps, you may be able to continue to embed and work with diagram files in your documents.
