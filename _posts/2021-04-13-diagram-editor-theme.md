You can customise the draw.io editor and choose your preferred theme for the user interface. The editor theme controls which editor elements are displayed, minimised or hidden in the user interface, including the menu, toolbar, panels and dialog boxes.

There are several different editor themes to choose from which work in both dark and light modes.

**Change the editor theme via the draw.io menu**

1. Open the draw.io menu and select _Settings > Theme_.
  * In the Simple editor theme, click on the three dots in the toolbar. 
  * In the Sketch editor theme, click on the three horizontal lines in the top left. 
  * In the Minimal editor theme, click on _Diagram_ in the top left. 
  * In the Atlas and Classic editor themes, click on _Extras > Theme_
2. Choose between Classic, Simple, Minimal, Sketch (a whiteboard-style theme), or Atlas.
3. If prompted, reload the draw.io editor to start using your selected editor theme. 

_Please visit GitHub to [leave feedback about the Sketch and Minimal editor themes](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio/discussions/1924) and help guide their development._

**Tip:** If you are new to diagramming, read the [introduction to the draw.io editor](/doc/getting-started-editor.html) that looks at all the various important elements.

The new [Simple editor theme](/blog/simple-mode-diagrams.html) has a streamlined toolbar and minimisable panels for a larger drawing canvas. 

## Classic

The Classic editor theme (previously the Kennedy theme), named after the Google UI, is the default style for draw.io, and shows the menu, toolbar, file name, language selector, fixed panels either side and diagram pages below the drawing canvas.

## Atlas

If you are used to using the draw.io apps on Atlassian Confluence or Jira, use the Atlas theme if you prefer to keep using that interface in the online draw.io editor or in draw.io Desktop.

The Atlas UI theme does not show the diagram's filename or the _Share_ button, but the rest of the editor elements are displayed in roughly the same positions.

## Minimal 

If you are diagramming on a tablet or a mobile device, the Minimal theme allows you to collapse the panels around the drawing canvas for less 'clutter'. The Minimal theme, or the Sketch (whiteboard) editor theme below are ideal for [remote kanban boards](/blog/kanban-boards.html)

**When using the Minimal theme**
* The menu is minimised to the _Diagram_ tool on the toolbar, panels can be toggled on and off as you need, or minimised to their titles to make room for more drawing. 
* The panels are floating in the Minimal theme, you can drag them to a new position over the drawing canvas.
* Select _Diagram > Preferences > Theme_ when using the Minimal editor theme to change to another one, then refresh the page.

If you are new to diagramming and feel overwhelmed with the number of tools displayed in a diagram editor, you may find the Minimal theme easier to use.

<br />_[Start using the draw.io editor with the Minimal theme](https://app.diagrams.net/?ui=min)_

## Sketch 

If you prefer minimal tools and the rough style enabled by default, like you would in a whiteboarding app, the Sketch editor theme is for you. This easy-to-use theme is set by default in the [draw.io Board macro](/blog/drawio-board-macro.html) for Confluence, and in the [draw.io for Notion Chrome extension](/blog/store-diagrams-notion.html).

The Sketch editor theme may also be useful to introduce younger children to diagramming or support them as they [add diagrams to their documents and in Google Classroom](/blog/google-classroom-diagrams.html) with the Google Drive add-in.

Enable the [Sketch editor theme](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html) in draw.io as you would any other theme and refresh the page. Alternatively, go to [sketch.diagrams.net](http://sketch.diagrams.net)

## Editor theme + Dark mode

If you prefer to work on a dark background with light outlines and text, or if you are creating an infographic that will be printed on a dark background, switch to dark mode in whatever editor theme you are currently using. 

Select _Extras > Appearance > Dark_ if you are using the Classic or Atlas editor themes. 

In all other themes, open the draw.io menu and select _Settings > Appearance > Dark_. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/sketch-settings-appearance.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Switch between dark and light modes via the draw.io menu under Settings > Appearance">

_[Start using the draw.io editor in Dark mode](https://app.diagrams.net/?ui=dark)_

_Automatic_ will automatically match your browser or operating system's dark mode settings.

**When using the Dark theme**
* **Adaptive colours for shared diagrams:** Colours will automatically adapt to whoever is viewing or editing your diagram, ensuring it remains readable in both dark and light mde. [_Learn more about adaptive colours_](/blog/adaptive-colours.html)
* **Exporting diagrams:** Set the background of your diagram to transparent before you export it to a PDF or image format, or choose to export it with a dark background (as if it were in dark mode).
