It's been a rather chaotic summer for all of us here at draw.io. Because _it's a Thursday_, to fit with the general craziness, here's a holiday-themed puzzle using one of the less-oft-used shape libraries. This library contains a large number of easy-to-recognise _skilfully crafted classical hand-tooled signs_, perfectly sitting at the bottom of your shape collection. 
<br />[<img src="/assets/img/blog/signs-shape-library-puzzle.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;height:auto;" alt="The signs shape library contains an eclectic collection of quickly recognisable shapes - great for infographics">](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&tags=1&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fmaster%2Fblog%2Fsigns-shape-library-puzzle.drawio)

A brain is a funny thing - it understands graphical signs _more than words can say_ and is more [powerful and productive when it can _think visually_](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6125597/). 

Because _it also likes riddles_, why not _steal some time and grab a coffee_, or perhaps _some more tea_, and let's see how many references to songs, bands, movies, books and memes you can guess.

## Puzzling signs for a good holiday

In this puzzle, first [open the diagram in draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&tags=1&layers=1&nav=1&title=#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fjgraph%2Fdrawio-diagrams%2Fmaster%2Fblog%2Fsigns-shape-library-puzzle.drawio), then hover over each of the shapes in the cross-functional table - the clues are in the tooltips.

Each shape in the diagram is a reference to one or more songs, movies/TV series, memes, and books. 
* Some belong to more than one media category. 
* Some have multiple references as famous lines are oft re-used. 
* There is one shape that is _not like the others_. 
* Bonus points - there are many extra _references in this post_.

_I can bet, you will never guess them all._

## Work with tooltips in draw.io

1. First, open a copy of the diagram in the draw.io editor. 
2. Right click on a shape and select **Edit** from the context menu. From there, you can add or edit the shape's tooltip.

**+ Note:** Don't edit the shape data unless you want additional hints _!!!!!_

## Tags are extra clues

Tags are not visible by default. In this puzzle, the tags are hints for the type of media the clue refers to (songs, movies/TV, memes or books). 

Click on the **View** tool in the toolbar to open the **Tags** dialog.

**Work with tags in draw.io**
* Click on the eye to the left of a tag name to hide and display shapes with that tag. 
* Click on the bottom _lidless eye to see all the shapes_ that were previously hidden.
* Click on the checkbox to the left of a tag name select all the shapes with that tag.

**Tip:** Both tags and tooltips can be edited via the shape data in the right-click context menu.
