With draw.io, you can switch [editor themes](/blog/diagram-editor-theme.html) via the menu - Classic, Simple, Minimal, Sketch (whiteboard) and Atlas. There are also editor **modes** to switch between dark and light modes.

## Switch between editor themes and dark/light modes in draw.io

**Open the draw.io menu:** 
* In the Simple theme, click on the three dots in the toolbar to open the draw.io menu. * In the Sketch theme, click on the three horizontal lines in the top left. 
* In the Minimal theme, click on _Diagram_ in the toolbar. 
* In Atlas and Classic themes, look under the _Extras_ menu.

**Change editor theme:** Select _Settings > Theme_ to change your editor theme. You can switch between _Simple_ and _Classic_ without needing to reload the browser tab. If you choose _Minimal_, _Sketch_ or _Atlas_, you will need to reload the browser tab.

**Switch to dark or light mode:** Select _Settings > Appearance_ and then _Light_ or _Dark_ to change between dark and light modes.

**Tip:** _Automatic_ should reflect your operating system or browser settings automatically (when they are set to dark mode).

### Dark mode works on all editor themes

When you switch into dark mode, the editor will automatically switch some colours of shapes and text so they are more readable.

**Tip:** Many diagrams in the template diagram also work well in dark mode - click on the magnifying glass in the top right of a diagram in the [template library](/blog/template-diagrams.html) to see a preview.

### Introducing the Simple editor theme

With the new Simple editor theme, we have redesigned toolbar and integrated the menu so the editor is sleeker and less distracting.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/simple-mode-toolbar.png" style="width=100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;" alt="The draw.io simple mode has a simpler toolbar which integrates the menu">

* Click on ``...`` (three dots) at the right end of the toolbar to open the settings and import/export menu. 

* Hide or display the format panel via _Format_ at the right end of the toolbar next to the mode switch. 

* Hide or display the shapes, layers, tags panel and other tools via _View_ at the left end of the toolbar.

* Use the tools in the middle to add shapes, text, freehand drawings and tables, as you would from the normal toolbar. 

* Click on the ``+`` in the middle to insert specific shapes, images, templates, or use the advanced text-to-diagram tools.

**Tip:** Hover over any of the tools or text to see a tooltip.

**Simplify the drawing canvas**
1. Make sure nothing is selected in your diagram so you can see the _Diagram_ tab in the format panel on the right. 
2. Disable the [_Grid_](/doc/faq/editor-grid-change.html) and [_Page View_](/doc/faq/editor-page-view.html) checkboxes.
