App editions for Atlassian Confluence Cloud will soon be available for customers who sign up for Atlassian's early-access program. App editions is a new Atlassian Marketplace feature introduced with Forge, and draw.io will be available in Standard and Advanced editions.

If you are not in the early access program, your draw.io Confluence Cloud app will continue to receive regular updates and support as in your current subscription, and of course, the full features of the draw.io diagram editor, including AI-generated diagrams.

If you sign up for the new early access programme for app Editions in the Atlassian Marketplace, draw.io will be available in the following two editions for Confluence Cloud.

* The _Standard edition_ includes all the diagramming features of the draw.io editor, including AI-generated diagrams. When you need support, your Confluence Cloud administrators can submit support tickets and receive the standard level of support (9/5 business hours).

* The _Advanced edition_ of draw.io for Atlassian Cloud products is for _large enterprise customers_ who require advanced support and stricter data security. Along with the fully featured draw.io app from the Standard edition, you will receive the following additional support: 
   * Extended support hours and shorter initial response times. 
   * Additional support for the online version of the draw.io editor at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) as well as [draw.io desktop](https://get.diagrams.net/) (when using Google Drive). 
   * A dedicated account manager as your single point of contact for enquiries.
   * Custom security reviews for compliance submissions. 
   * Access to development feature previews. 
   * In-depth and targeted training materials. 
   * A zero-egress switch that can disable all data egress except for Atlassian API calls in the draw.io Forge app version.
