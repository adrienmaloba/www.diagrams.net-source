In addition to updating the main [AWS](/blog/aws-diagrams.html) and [Azure](/blog/azure-diagrams.html) shape libraries in draw.io, several new networking and cloud shape libraries have been added, including shapes for Alibaba Cloud, Dynamics365 and OpenStack.

## Open cloud infrastructure shape libraries

1. Click on _More Shapes_ at the bottom of the shapes panel on the left.

1. Scroll down to the _Networking_ section and enable the shape libraries you want to use.

2. Click _Apply_ to open them in the shapes panel next to the drawing canvas. 


**Tip:** Alternatively, you can always search for a shape if you know its name. For example, searching for "AWS beanstalk" will show all the shapes from the various AWS libraries that have both "AWS" and "beanstalk" in their shape names, even if you don't have the AWS shape libraries open. Hover over any of the shapes to see a larger preview.

## Azure Power Platform and Dynamics 365

The Power Platform shapes have been added to the Azure shape library. These components are often combined with Dynamics365 services and applications in cloud infrastructures. 

*Tip:** If you prefer to [diagram in dark mode](/blog/dark-mode-diagram-editor.html), the Azure and Dynamics365 shapes and their labels will automatically change colours to remain readable when you switch between dark and light modes.

## OpenStack shapes= library

OpenStack services and apps are common components of Citrix, GCP, IBM and other large hybrid cloud infrastructures. To clearly indicate which components are provided by OpenStack in your infrastructure diagrams, enable the OpenStack shape library.

## Alibaba Cloud shape library

Enable the Alibaba Cloud shape library to document your infrastructure in Alibaba Cloud platform. These shapes cover a wide range of apps and services.

Most of the infrastructure shapes don't have labels by default, as designers tend to rely on logo-recognition for their infrastructure components.

To make your diagram more accessible, select a shape and start typing to add a label. In the _Text_ tab of the format panel, select the _Bottom_ position, and update the Font Colour to match the colour of the Alibaba shape so it is consistent.

**Tip:** Format one shape and click on _Copy Style_ in the _Style_ tab of the format panel. Then, right-click on the canvas and choose _Select Vertices_, deselect any regions you may have added, and then click on _Paste Style_ in the Style tab to copy the style onto all of the selected shapes.
