User-defined colours for [dark mode](/blog/dark-mode-diagrams.html) override the automatic adaptive colour settings in the _Simple_ adaptive colour mode. You can reset all user-defined dark-mode colours on a diagram page to their automatic defaults with a shortcut. 

1. Press ``Ctrl+Shift+6`` to open the Adaptive Colors dialog. 
2. Deselect the _Background_ or _Labels_ colours if you want to keep their user-defined values. 
3. Click _Remove User-defined_ to reset the adaptive colours.

This ensures your diagram will have a uniform appearance for all shapes, connectors and labels in both dark and light modes.

**Note:** Adaptive colour and user-defined colours are saved per diagram page. To reset user-defined colours in a multi-page diagram, you will need to repeat this on every page of your multi-page diagram.
