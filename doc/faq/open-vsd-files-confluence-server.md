While ``.vsd``, ``.vdx`` and ``.vss`` import is not supported in draw.io, you can convert to modern ``.vsdx`` formats first, and then to draw.io.

**Convert to a ``.vsdx`` diagram:** Open the diagram file in your normal Microsoft editor, version 2013 or later, and save it as a ``.vsdx`` file. Create a new draw.io diagram, then drag and drop the ``.vsdx`` file into the diagram editor.
