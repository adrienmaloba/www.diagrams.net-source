The desktop version of draw.io is a standalone application which does not send any data outside of your device.

While ``.vsd``, ``.vdx`` and ``.vss`` import is not supported in draw.io, you can convert to modern ``.vsdx`` formats first, and then to draw.io via our free web application at [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)

**Convert to a ``.vsdx`` diagram:** Open the diagram file in your normal Microsoft editor, version 2013 or later, and save it as a ``.vsdx`` file. Create a new draw.io diagram, then drag and drop the ``.vsdx`` file into the diagram editor.

## Convert a .vsdx diagram file to .drawio

1. Go to [our online editor](https://app.diagrams.net)
2. Drag and drop the ``.vsdx`` file onto the drawing canvas, and draw.io will automatically import it.
3. Select _File > Save_ from the menu, change the filename if necessary, then select _Device_ as the target.
4. Open the ``.drawio`` diagram file as normal in your draw.io Desktop app.
