1. If you select a cloud storage location, you may be prompted to authorise the editor and grant it permission to read and edit files stored on that platform.

draw.io will automatically remember where you have last stored your diagram files. If you used your browser, it will automatically open your most recent diagram.

**Tip:** Select _Device_ to save the diagram file to your local device.
