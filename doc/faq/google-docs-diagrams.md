1. Open your ``.drawio`` diagram file in the draw.io editor (either our [online editor](https://app.diagrams.net) or [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net/))
2. In the draw.io menu, select _File > Export As > PNG_, then click _Export_ to save your diagram as an image. 
3. In your Google Document, Slide, or Sheet select _Insert Image_ from the menu, or drag and drop your image into your document. 

You can work with the image of your diagram in your Google document (Docs, Slides or Sheets) as you would any other image - move, resize, rotate, and style it as needed.

When you update a draw.io diagram, you will need to re-export it to a PNG file, and re-import it into your Google document.

**Note:** Your diagram data is only ever stored in your browser and on your Google Drive account.

**Important:** Google has implemented new security permission limitations for apps that access files stored in Google Drive. 

If you have previously installed the draw.io app for Docs, Sheets or Slides, it may still work. However, we recommend that you convert all embedded diagrams to images following the instructions above. 

New installations of the draw.io apps for Google Docs, Sheets and Slides will not function correctly.
